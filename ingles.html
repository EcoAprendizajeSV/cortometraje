                    The short film narrates the life of Charlie, a brilliant student who has always stood out for his
                    dedication and academic effort. Since he was a child, his dreams were big, but everything changes when
                    he enters adolescence and joins a group of friends in high school: Jorge and Eduardo. Although at
                    first the friendship seems harmless, it soon turns into negative pressure when they invite him to explore a nearby pond, a place that becomes the stage for his transformation.

            The story concludes with a reflection based on <strong>Proverbs 22:6:</strong>
            "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."
            The young people understand that true influence comes from those who inspire them to be the best version
            of themselves. They decide that they will not let peer pressure divert them from their dreams, always choosing the
            path that brings them closer to their goals.

                <h4>Christopher García</h4>
                <p>I love how the short film addresses social pressure. Charlie is a very real character and his
                    decision at the end is inspiring.</p>

                <h4>Jorge Hernandez</h4>
                <p>A moving short film. It reflects what many young people face in their daily lives.
                    I would definitely recommend it.</p>

                <h4>Eduardo Martinez</h4>
                <p>I identified a lot with Charlie. Sometimes peer pressure can be overwhelming, but it's
                    important to remember that our dreams and values are what really matter. This short film
                    inspired me to be stronger in the face of negative influences.</p>

                <h4>Jocelyn Moran</h4>
                <p>It's a great reminder that true friendship is not measured by what we do, but by how
                    we support others.</p>
